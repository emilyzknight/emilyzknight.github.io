Geomatics Engineering Student \u00b6 University of Calgary \u00b6 Hi! My name is Emily Knight and I am an an MSc. Geomatics Engineering student at the University of Calgary specialising in digital imaging systems and space physics. My research focuses on exploring how multispectral all-sky imagers can enhance our understanding of auroral activity. I am an Electrical Engineer-in-Training (EIT), registered in the Province of Alberta which supports my technical approach to system design and implementation. My multi-disciplinary background bridges the fields of electrical and geomatics engineering, with a focus on developing advanced imaging systems for scientific applications. I\u2019m always eager to connect with fellow engineers and researchers. If you\u2019re interested in discussing collaborations or learning more about my work, feel free to reach out.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#emily-knight","text":"","title":"Emily Knight"},{"location":"#msc-geomatics-engineering-student","text":"","title":"MSc.
